## ü§ñ AI Integration (Original Plan)

### Gemini API Implementation
**Original Intent**: The project was initially designed to use Google's Gemini API for intelligent skill extraction and matching.

#### Planned Workflow:
1. **Skill Extraction**: Parse job description to extract required skills
2. **Resume Analysis**: Analyze uploaded resume for matching skills
3. **Compatibility Score**: Generate match percentage
4. **Recommendations**: Suggest skills to highlight in application

#### Why We Simplified:
After testing, we decided to **remove the AI vetting system** and focus on a **prompt-based workflow** where users maintain full control. This reduces complexity, eliminates API dependencies, and gives users agency over what they track.

#### Current Approach:
- **No automatic skill extraction**
- **User-driven input**: Users manually confirm and edit extracted data
- **Optional fields**: Users can add notes about skills/qualifications themselves
- Focus on **speed and simplicity** over automated analysis

**Note**: The Gemini integration code was removed to streamline the extension, but the architecture supports re-enabling it if needed in the future.

## üîç Job Detection Logic

### Detection Restrictions (3-Step Validation)

The extension uses **strict validation** to minimize false positives:

#### Step 1: URL Pattern Matching
```javascript
// ‚úÖ MUST match one of these patterns:
const jobPatterns = [
  /linkedin\.com\/jobs\/view/,
  /indeed\.com\/viewjob/,
  /indeed\.com\/.*\/jobs\//,
  /greenhouse\.io\/.*\/jobs\//,
  /lever\.co\/.*\/jobs\//,
  /jobs\.lever\.co/,
  /workday\.com\/.*\/job\//,
  /myworkdayjobs\.com/,
  /sap\.com\/.*\/job-detail/,
  /jobs\.sap\.com/,
  /\/careers?\/.*\/job\//,
  /\/job-details?\//,
  /\/positions?\//,
  /\/openings?\//,
  /requisition.*id/i,
  /job[-_]?id/i
];

// ‚ùå MUST NOT match exclusion patterns:
const excludePatterns = [
  /\/search/,
  /\/results/,
  /\/browse/,
  /google\.com/,
  /bing\.com/
];
```

#### Step 2: Content Verification
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Page MUST contain job-related keywords:
const keywords = [
  'apply', 'application', 'job description', 
  'qualifications', 'responsibilities', 
  'requirements', 'experience', 'skills'
];

// Minimum 3 keywords must be present
```

#### Step 3: Requisition ID Detection
```javascript
// ‚úÖ OR find a requisition ID pattern:
const requisitionPatterns = [
  /req(?:uisition)?[:\s-]?#?\s*([A-Z0-9-]+)/i,
  /job[:\s-]?#?\s*([A-Z0-9-]+)/i,
  /position[:\s-]?#?\s*([A-Z0-9-]+)/i,
  /opening[:\s-]?#?\s*([A-Z0-9-]+)/i
];
```

**Logic**: A page is considered a job posting if:
- (URL matches job patterns AND NOT exclusion patterns) 
- AND (Contains 3+ keywords OR has requisition ID)

### Data Extraction Rules

#### Role Extraction Priority
1. `<meta property="og:title">` content
2. `<h1>` tags
3. Elements with class/id containing "job-title", "position", "role"
4. Fallback: "Unknown Role"

#### Company Extraction Priority
1. `<meta property="og:site_name">` content
2. Elements with class/id containing "company"
3. **Smart Domain Fallbacks**:
   - `sap.com` ‚Üí "SAP"
   - `greenhouse.io` ‚Üí Extract from subdomain
   - `lever.co` ‚Üí Extract from subdomain
   - Generic: Clean up domain name
4. Fallback: "Unknown Company"

#### URL Extraction
- Uses `window.location.href`
- Strips tracking parameters for cleaner URLs

## üöÄ Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Infinite Loading Issue
**Problem**: Extension stuck on "Checking page..." indefinitely

**Solution**: 
- Added 3-second timeout with `setTimeout()`
- Show error message with retry button after timeout
- Clear timeout when response received

### 2. SAP Careers Detection
**Problem**: SAP's career pages weren't being detected (no "Apply" button, different URL structure)

**Solution**:
- Added SAP-specific URL patterns: `/sap\.com\/.*\/job-detail/`, `/jobs\.sap\.com/`
- Implemented requisition ID detection as alternative validation method
- Added fallback company extraction for `sap.com` domain

### 3. False Positives on Search Pages
**Problem**: Job search results pages were triggering detection

**Solution**:
- Added exclusion patterns: `/search/`, `/results/`, `/browse/`
- Increased keyword threshold from 1 to 3
- Required requisition ID OR multiple keywords (not just one indicator)

### 4. Inconsistent Design
**Problem**: Mixed border radius values (4px, 6px, 8px, 12px, 14px) across UI elements

**Solution**:
- Established design system with 4-tier scale: 8px, 10px, 12px, 16px
- Applied consistently across all components
- Documented in style guide

### 5. CSS Caching in Extension
**Problem**: Style changes not appearing after updates

**Solution**:
- Hard reload extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Close and reopen popup to clear cache
- Use Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh on options page

## üé¨ Presentation Talking Points

### Opening
> "Beacon is a Chrome extension that turns job hunting chaos into organized tracking. It automatically detects when you're on a job posting and prompts you to save your application with just a few clicks."

### Problem Statement
> "Job seekers apply to dozens of companies but lose track of where they applied, when they applied, and what resume version they used. Beacon solves this by capturing application details the moment you apply."

### Key Innovation
> "Unlike other trackers that require manual entry, Beacon intelligently detects job postings across 20+ platforms and pre-fills all the data for you. We use strict 3-step validation to avoid false positives."

### Technical Highlights
> "Built with Chrome Manifest V3, Express.js backend, and AWS services (S3 for resumes, DynamoDB for data). The extension uses advanced pattern matching to detect jobs on enterprise ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday‚Äînot just LinkedIn and Indeed."

### Design Philosophy
> "We designed Beacon with dynamic visual feedback: the header turns blue when a job is detected, pink when it's not. This gives users instant confidence that the extension is working."

### AI Integration Story
> "We initially planned to use Google's Gemini API for skill extraction and resume matching, but decided to remove it for simplicity. Users prefer full control over their data rather than automated analysis."

### Future Vision
> "Next steps include building a dashboard to visualize application pipelines, adding email reminders for follow-ups, and potentially re-enabling AI for personalized insights."
