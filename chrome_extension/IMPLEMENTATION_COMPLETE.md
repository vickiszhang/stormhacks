## 🚀 Next Steps to Use

### 1. Update AWS DynamoDB Table
Your existing table may have the old schema. You have two options:

**Option A: Create New Table** (Recommended)
```bash
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name JobApplications
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name JobApplications \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=ApplicationID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=ApplicationID,KeyType=HASH \
    --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
    --region us-east-1
```

**Option B: Keep Existing Table**
- The new schema is compatible (just has different fields)
- Old applications will have old fields, new ones will have new fields
- Consider migrating data if needed

### 2. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Job Application Tracker"
3. Click the reload icon 🔄
4. Test on a job posting page!

### 3. Test the New Workflow
1. Visit a job posting (e.g., LinkedIn)
2. Click extension icon
3. You should see: "📋 Job application detected!"
4. Verify extracted data
5. Add notes if desired
6. Click "Track Application"
7. Check DynamoDB to see saved data
