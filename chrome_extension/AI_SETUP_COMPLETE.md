# AI Verification + Notification Fix - Setup Guide

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Notification System
**File**: `content.js`
- ✅ Added storage listener to detect when popup opens/closes
- ✅ Increased notification delay to 1.5s for better page load detection
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging
- ✅ Notification now properly hides when popup opens

**How it works**:
```javascript
// When page loads → Detects job → Checks if popup open → Shows notification
// When popup opens → Storage listener triggers → Hides notification
```

### 2. Restored AI Verification (Secondary Check)
**Files**: `server.js`, `popup.js`

#### Backend (`server.js`):
- ✅ Added `/ai-verify-job` endpoint
- ✅ Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model
- ✅ Analyzes page content (up to 8000 chars)
- ✅ Returns confidence score (0-100%)
- ✅ Extracts job title and company name

#### Frontend (`popup.js`):
- ✅ Added "AI Verify" button when job not detected
- ✅ Shows loading animation during AI analysis
- ✅ Displays AI confidence and reasoning
- ✅ If confidence ≥ 70% → Shows tracking form
- ✅ If confidence < 70% → Shows reasoning + retry option
- ✅ Error handling for missing API key or backend issues

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Detection Flow:
```
User visits page
  ↓
Wait 1.5 seconds
  ↓
Pattern detection runs (content.js)
  ↓
┌─────────────────┴──────────────────┐
│                                    │
Job detected                    Not detected
  ↓                                  ↓
Show notification              User opens popup
(if popup not open)                  ↓
  ↓                            Shows "Not a job posting"
User clicks extension icon            ↓
  ↓                            User clicks "AI Verify"
Notification disappears               ↓
  ↓                            AI analyzes page content
Show tracking form                    ↓
                              ┌───────┴────────┐
                              │                │
                        Confidence ≥70%   Confidence <70%
                              ↓                ↓
                        Show form      Show reasoning
```

### What Gets Detected Automatically:
✅ LinkedIn (`/jobs/view/`)
✅ Indeed (`/viewjob`)
✅ Databricks (`/careers/*/[id]`)
✅ Greenhouse (`/jobs/`)
✅ Lever
✅ Workday
✅ EA, SAP, and 15+ other patterns

### What Needs AI Verification:
⚠️ Small startups with unusual URLs
⚠️ Custom company career pages
⚠️ New job boards not in pattern list
⚠️ Non-standard job posting structures

## 🔍 Debugging Notification Issues

### Notification Not Showing?

**Check 1**: Open browser console (F12) on job page
```javascript
// Should see this log after 1.5 seconds:
"Job detected! Popup open status: false"
```

**Check 2**: Is popup already open?
```javascript
// In console:
chrome.storage.local.get(['popupOpen'], console.log)
// Should return: {popupOpen: false} when popup closed
```

**Check 3**: Is notification being created?
```javascript
// After page loads:
document.getElementById('job-tracker-notification')
// Should return the notification div if visible
```

**Check 4**: Check content script loaded
```javascript
// In console:
typeof isJobApplicationPage
// Should return: "function"
```

### Notification Shows But Won't Dismiss?

**Fix**: Reload extension and refresh page
```
chrome://extensions/ → Click reload on Beacon
Refresh job page
```
